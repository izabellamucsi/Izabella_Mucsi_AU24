/* Utilizing the returning fuction in the first iteration I solved the first three tasks in one step for each of the favorite movie and I inserted the Rush, Senna and Drive to Survive as favorite movies.
 * This first iteration uses CTEs and the returning clause to pass each of the favorite movies along with the actors into the `film`, `actor`, and `film_actor` tables if they don't already exist. 
 * Below this iteration, I also solved the first three task in seperate queries.
/* 1.1 Choose your top-3 favorite movies and add them to the 'film' table  */
/* 1.2 Fill in rental rates with 4.99, 9.99 and 19.99 and rental durations with 1, 2 and 3 weeks respectively. */
/* 1.3 Add the actors who play leading roles in your favorite movies to the 'actor' and 'film_actor' tables (6 or more actors in total).  */ */
